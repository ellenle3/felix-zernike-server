# spots2zern

The spots2zern.py script converts FELIX spot positions to Zernike coefficients.
The script takes spot positions as inputs as such:

    python spots2zern.py x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4

For example,

    >>> python spots2zern.py 1 1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1
    RC 0
    MSG success
    ZTIP 0.000000
    ZTILT 0.000000
    ZFOCUS 0.288675
    ZASTIG1 -0.000000
    ZASTIG2 0.000000

Note the ordering of the coordinates; spot 1 is in the upper right quadrant,
spot 2 is in the lower right, 3 is in the upper left, and 4 is in the lower left.
The number of modes, spot rotation, scaling, and other parameters can be changed
in config.py.

The script works by using a theoretical interaction matrix (stored in data/imat.npy
by default) to convert slopes to Zernike coefficients. A new theoretical interaction
matrix may be generated by using the script reconstruction.py.
